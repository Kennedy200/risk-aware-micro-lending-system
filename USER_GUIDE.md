VantageRisk AI: User Guide & Technical Documentation

🛡️ VantageRisk AI: Technical Documentation

Project Topic: 16 - Utility-Based Decision-Making Systems
Application: Risk-Aware Micro-Lending Decision Engine
Version: 1.0.4-Stable

1. Project Overview
VantageRisk AI is a sophisticated decision-support system designed for micro-lending institutions. Unlike traditional credit scoring models that provide simple categorical classifications, this system utilizes Von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) Expected Utility Theory to optimize lending decisions. It balances the probability of default (derived via Machine Learning) against potential financial profit, adjusted by a dynamic risk-aversion coefficient (𝜆).

2. System Requirements
To run this application, your environment must meet the following specifications:
Operating System: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux.
Python: Version 3.10 or higher.
Node.js: Version 18.0 or higher.
Browser: Chrome, Edge, or Firefox (Latest versions).

3. Installation Guide
Step 1: Backend Setup
Open your terminal and navigate to the /backend directory.
Install the required AI and API libraries:
code
Bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost joblib fastapi uvicorn
Ensure lending_model.pkl and scaler.pkl are present in this folder.

Step 2: Frontend Setup
Navigate to the /frontend directory.
Install the web dependencies:
code
Bash
npm install


4. Execution Workflow
A. Start the AI Engine (Backend)
In your backend terminal, run:
code
Bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
The server will initialize at http://localhost:8000. You can view the API documentation at /docs.

B. Start the User Interface (Frontend)
In a second terminal, inside the /frontend folder, run:
code
Bash
npm run dev
Access the platform at http://localhost:3000.


5. Using the Application
1. Authentication
Access the Bank Officer Portal using authorized credentials (any valid email/password combination in this prototype).

2. The Input Engine
Enter the applicant's financial metadata:
Annual Income: Gross yearly earnings.
FICO Score: Historical credit reliability (300-850).
DTI Ratio: Existing debt load percentage.
Risk-Aversion (𝜆): Move the slider to set the bank's current risk appetite (1.0 = Aggressive, 5.0 = Conservative).

3. AI Inference
Click "Analyze & Make Decision". The system will:
Normalize inputs using the StandardScaler.
Generate a risk probability via the Logistic Regression model.
Calculate the Expected Utility score.
Render a verdict (APPROVE or REJECT).

4. Audit & Compliance
Scroll down to the System Audit Trail to verify that the transaction has been persisted in the local SQLite instance (lending.db) for regulatory review.

6. Technical Architecture
AI Engine: Scikit-Learn Logistic Regression.
Inference Engine: FastAPI (Asynchronous Python).
Frontend: Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS + Lucide Icons.
Database: SQLite 3.
Logic Framework: Von Neumann-Morgenstern Expected Utility Theorem.

7. Troubleshooting
Connection Error: Ensure the Backend terminal is running on Port 8000 before clicking "Analyze."
Missing Data: If the Audit Log is empty, refresh the browser after a successful analysis.
Model Not Found: Ensure lending_model.pkl was generated by running train_ai.py first.
